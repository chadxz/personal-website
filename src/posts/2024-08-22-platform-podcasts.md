After giving my talk at [DevOpsDays Birmingham in 2023](/platform/), I was
invited to appear on two podcasts to discuss Platform Engineering further! The
questions helped me to think more deeply about some things, such as how process,
team topologies, and platform engineering are deeply intertwined.

These podcast episodes have been available for a while, but wanted to share them
here as well for posterity! I hope you enjoy - hit me up on LinkedIn if you have
thoughts you want to share, happy to chat.
